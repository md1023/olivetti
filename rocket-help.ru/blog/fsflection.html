        <h3>Notes on Richard Stallman's lecture. 2 December 2011.</h3>
        <p>I was in a hurry making it to the lecture hall in time. At the hall I ran into Richard when he asked <q>where's the toilet?</q> his companion. That was fun. I didn't manage to say any <q>hello</q> just not to feel stupid.</p>
        <p>There in a conference hall I took a seat and after short while we all began to listen to Stallman's words carefully. His speech is very accurate, pronounciation is sharp and voice is rather high and clear.</p>
        <p>I'm going to write down notes from textbook now. Main ideas of Richard's speech.</p>
        <h3>There are four kinds of software freedom:</h3>
        <ol start="0">
            <li>you can run programs as you wish</li>
            <li>you can study and change source code of a program</li>
            <li>you can help others by distributing, sharing copies of a program</li>
            <li>you can distribute modified copies of a program</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Given those rules cannot be applied to certain program - means someone else wants to control user. Like yoke (ярмо, бремя, иго).</p>
        <p>In 1993 was the start of movement to make free operating system. The GNU system. It is an animal from Africa and also a reverse acronim. The proper way to say is to say <q>GNU Linux</q>.</p>
        <p>Just to be precise let's clarify that OpenSource not made to be free. It doesn't make up with formal freedom position described in the list above.</p>
        <p>Proprietary software cause harmful influence in school classes. School must have ability to share and redistribute knowledge. Change of technology can't change moral and ethic. <q>Facebook is not your friend!</q>Censorship is not a copyright. Copyright initially exist for public in constitution of USA and only publisher were restricted by them not users. Big companies like Sony have enough money to commit felony, enforce laws and create virtual handcuffs for digital control. Biggest copyright act is the MickeyMouse copyright which should expire at 2018. Afterwards Disney should propose new account sheet for next 75 years and make an excuse by extending MickeyMouse copyright. Goverment and corporation have conspirancy to fix prices on redistributable material.</p>
        <p class="icon note">Non-commercial republication should be available in 5-10 years - enough for copyright to expire rather than 75-100 years. One man's child could not live up to a moment when a product can be redistributed.</p>
        <p><q>Censorship - intolerable evil.</q> Money could be sent to artists either by taxfunds - by popularity polling and volunatry payments - 5-10 rubles should be enough and not so much. Also there should be easy way to pay money.</p>
        <p>Creative commons have 2 free licenses and 4 others that allow sharing. For software distribution GNU licence version 3 should be appropriate.</p>
